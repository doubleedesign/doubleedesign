### 👋 I'm Leesa with a Double-E 

🌐 I have a strong background in web development (from design and front-end, to full-stack more recently). 

:notebook: I’m currently working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology (Programming) and Bachelor of Design (Digital Technologies)
:computer: and working as a software engineering intern.

📂 I've organised my work into [projects](https://github.com/doubleedesign?tab=projects) so you can more easily find examples of my code relevant to you.

🏫 I also teach web development and introductory programming.

⚡ Fun fact: I own 35 pairs of Dr Martens.
