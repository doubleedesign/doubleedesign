### 👋 I'm Leesa with a Double-E 

🌐 &nbsp;I have a strong background in web development (from design and front-end, to full-stack more recently). 

:computer: I'm currently working as a software engineering intern, working with JavaScript/TypeScript/React.

---

:notebook:  &nbsp;I’m currently working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology (Programming), <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bachelor of Design (Digital Technologies), and Diploma of Software Development.

🏫 I also teach web development and introductory programming.

📂 I've organised my work into [projects](https://github.com/doubleedesign?tab=projects) so you can more easily find examples of my code relevant to you.

⚡ Fun fact: I own 35 pairs of Dr Martens.
