### 👋 I'm Leesa with a Double-E 

I have a strong background in web development (from design and front-end, to full-stack more recently).

:notebook: I’m currently working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology
:computer: and I’m looking for a software development internship.

  I've organised my work into [projects](https://github.com/doubleedesign?tab=projects) so you can more easily find examples of my code relevant to you.

🏫 I also teach web development and introductory programming.

⚡ Fun fact: I own 35 pairs of Dr Martens.
