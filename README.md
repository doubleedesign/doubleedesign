### 👋 I'm Leesa with a Double-E 

🌐 &nbsp;I have a strong background in web development, primarily front-end but enjoy dabbling in full-stack.

:clock10: I spent the first chunk of my career in agency environments, building custom CMS themes (first Drupal, then WordPress - so PHP, HTML, CSS/SCSS, vanilla JS, jQuery) and occasionally plugins.

:computer: I currently work as a front-end software engineer in an enterprise environment (working with JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Styled Components) while continuing to design and build custom WordPress sites on a freelance basis.


📂 I've organised my work into [projects](https://github.com/doubleedesign?tab=projects&type=classic) so you can more easily find examples of my code relevant to you. I also post WordPress customisation snippets, amongst other miscellaneous code things, as [gists](https://gist.github.com/doubleedesign).

:notebook:  &nbsp;I’m currently working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology (Programming) and Bachelor of Design (Digital Technologies).

🏫 I also teach web development, introductory programming, and WordPress development at Diploma and Associate Degree levels.

⚡ Fun fact: I own 35 pairs of Dr Martens.
